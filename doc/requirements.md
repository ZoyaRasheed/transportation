# Transportation & Loading Department Coordination App

The Transportation & Loading Department Coordination App is designed to streamline communication and coordination between the Loading and Transportation departments. The primary goal of this application is to ensure efficient truck movements, timely loading, and smooth communication between yard switchers and the loading team — reducing delays and minimizing reliance on radio-based communication.

## Core Objectives

1. Simplify truck movement requests between departments.
2. Replace radio communication with digital notifications.
3. Provide visibility into truck availability, location, and loading door assignments.
4. Ensure switchers receive real-time alerts when a truck is requested.
5. Allow supervisors to monitor all requests, statuses, and completion times.
6. Include a mechanism to handle truck and door-related issues effectively.

## System Roles

### 1. Loading Department Interface
Used by loaders or coordinators to request trucks at specific doors. They can submit a truck request, include door number, and add optional notes such as "ready to load" or "remove empty trailer".

### 2. Transportation Department Interface
Used by switchers and dispatchers to view pending truck requests, acknowledge assignments, and mark requests as completed. Dispatchers can track switcher activity and truck status in real-time.

### 3. Supervisors
Have full visibility into both departments' activities, including truck request history, response times, completion metrics, and issue reports.

## Notification System

When the Loading Department submits a request for a truck, a notification is automatically sent to the Transportation Department. Switchers working in the yard (who do not use laptops) should be able to receive notifications on their handheld devices or mobile phones. These notifications must include details such as door number, truck type, and priority level.

Notifications can also include sound or vibration alerts to ensure that the switchers notice them quickly, especially during busy hours.

## Request Flow

1. Loading team requests a truck via their dashboard.
2. The request is logged in the database with a timestamp and door number.
3. A notification is immediately sent to all available switchers.
4. The first switcher to accept the task will be assigned automatically.
5. The dispatcher and supervisor can track who accepted it and the current progress.
6. Once the truck is moved or task completed, the switcher marks the request as "Done."
7. The system logs the completion time for performance analytics.

## Truck & Door Issue Management

To handle real-world challenges such as unavailable trucks, door malfunctions, or maintenance delays, the app will include an issue management module:

- **Door Issues**: When a door is blocked, damaged, or under repair, it can be marked as "Unavailable." This prevents new truck requests for that door until it's reactivated.
- **Truck Maintenance**: Trucks that are in the shop or temporarily out of service can be flagged in the system. Such trucks will not appear in the available list until they are cleared by maintenance or supervisors.
- **Automatic Notifications**: If an unavailable door or truck becomes active again, a notification will automatically be sent to both departments.
- **Supervisor Override**: Supervisors can manually override or clear issue statuses if needed, for example, when a door has been repaired or a replacement truck is available.
- **Visual Indicators**: The dashboard can display color-coded alerts (e.g., red for issues, green for available) to quickly highlight operational constraints.

## Incident Reporting & Delays

In addition to technical issues, the system allows team members to report delays or incidents affecting truck movement and loading schedules.

- **Weather or Traffic Delays**: If external factors cause a delay, dispatchers can log it for record-keeping.
- **Mechanical Failures**: Switchers or transportation staff can report if a truck breaks down while being moved.
- **Loading Delays**: Loaders can report issues such as slow loading, missing pallets, or safety concerns.
- **Incident Logs**: All reported incidents are stored with timestamps, affected doors/trucks, and responsible staff, so supervisors can analyze performance and recurring issues.

This ensures accountability and transparency across both departments.

## Additional Features (Planned Enhancements)

- Door status tracking (Occupied, Empty, Loading, etc.)
- History and reports of all truck requests and completion times
- Supervisor dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Role-based access control for different department users
- Optional offline mode for yard devices to sync when connected

## Security and Data Management

All request, issue, and status data will be stored securely and accessible only to authorized personnel. The system should maintain logs of every action — who made the request, who accepted it, and when it was completed — to ensure transparency and accountability across departments.

## Summary

This app will act as a bridge between the Loading and Transportation departments by replacing manual and radio-based communication with a modern, real-time system. It will help reduce truck idle time, improve coordination, manage door and truck issues effectively, and provide management with valuable insights into efficiency, performance, and recurring operational problems.
