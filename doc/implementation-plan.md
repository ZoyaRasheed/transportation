### Database Relationships

#### User-Centric Relationships
- Users create TruckRequests (one-to-many)
- Users are assigned TruckRequests (one-to-many)
- Users report Issues (one-to-many)
- Users receive Notifications (one-to-many)

#### Operational Relationships
- TruckRequests reference Doors (many-to-one)
- TruckRequests reference Trucks (many-to-one)
- Issues can relate to TruckRequests, Doors, or Trucks
- Notifications are triggered by TruckRequests and Issues

### Indexing Strategy
```
users: email (unique), role, department, isActive
truckRequests: status, doorNumber, requestedAt, assignedTo
doors: doorNumber (unique), status, isActive
trucks: truckId (unique), status, currentLocation
issues: status, type, severity, reportedAt
notifications: userId, status, createdAt, type
```
